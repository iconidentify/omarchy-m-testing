"""Temporary test packages: installed without a question (the disclaimer covers them), removed when the section ends.

    ready = packages.temporary(ctx, ["glmark2", "vkmark"], "The GPU benchmarks")
    if ready.skipped:
        return [human.skip(...) or an automatic skip with ready.skipped as the reason]

What happens:

  1. Packages already installed are left alone: they are never installed,
     and never removed.
  2. pacman works out exactly which packages installing the rest brings in,
     dependencies included (`pacman -Sp --needed`), from the repositories as
     they are synced now: the tool never syncs or upgrades (-Sy would be a
     partial upgrade). None of them may be a kernel, firmware or boot
     package (safety.py).
  3. The human is shown that list and it is installed without a question:
     accepting the disclaimer (consent.py) agreed to temporary test
     packages. Nothing else is ever installed this way.
  4. sudo: its cached credentials, or at a terminal `sudo -v`, which asks
     for the password there (the human is at the Mac, running the tool).
     Off a terminal without cached credentials the checks are skipped.
     If any of them is installed already (a dependency needs a newer
     version: an upgrade), nothing is installed.
  5. The restorer (`sudo -n pacman -R --noconfirm` exactly that list, those
     still installed when it runs) is registered, then
     `sudo -n pacman -S --needed --noconfirm --asdeps` runs.
     --asdeps: should removing them ever fail, they are orphans pacman
     offers to clean up, not packages the user seems to have chosen.
  6. What is actually installed afterwards is checked with pacman, and the
     restorer narrowed to exactly that (dropped if nothing was).

Removal runs with the section's other restorers: when it ends, on an error,
on Ctrl-C, or first thing in the next run if this one was killed.
