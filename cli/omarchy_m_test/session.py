"""A run's sections, the restorer registry and the checkpoint.

Sections: a run is a list of sections (sections.py), listed up front. The
human can skip any of them (the picker at a terminal, --skip anywhere); a
skipped section's checks are reported as skipped, never as failures.

Restorers: a section that changes the machine does it through
Changes.make(description, change, restore), which registers the command that
undoes it *before* making the change. Restorers run, newest first, when the
section ends, on an error and on an interrupt. They are kept in the
checkpoint too, so a run killed outright (power loss, a closed terminal
before the signal handler ran) has them run by the next run, before anything
else. A restorer that needs root (sudo=True: removing temporary packages)
runs `sudo -n`; if sudo's cached credentials ran out and the human is at a
terminal, `sudo -v` asks for the password there first. A restorer that
removes packages lists them (packages=...): only those pacman still has
installed are removed, so a run killed before or during the install doesn't
leave a removal that fails on the ones that never arrived. changes.py and
packages.py build the restorers for volume, Wi-Fi and temporary packages.

Disruptive sections (disruptive=True: they could cut the connection or the
session, like dropping Wi-Fi or sleeping) are skipped, with the reason, over
SSH or without a local seat (presence.py).

Checkpoint: after each section, the run's state (the sections chosen, the
results of the finished ones, pending restorers) is written to
$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy-m-test/checkpoint.json (~/.local/state/...). A run that
finds one for the same tool, catalogue, Mac and kernel offers to resume: the
finished sections aren't run again, the interrupted one starts over. It also
keeps the serial values and device names the scrubber learned from the finished sections, so the
resumed run removes them from its own evidence too. The checkpoint is removed
once the report is written.
