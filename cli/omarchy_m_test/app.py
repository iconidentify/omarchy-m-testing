"""The whole CLI run: refuse non-Apple machines, disclaimer, sections, report, upload.

Sections run one after another (session.py): each is checkpointed when it
finishes, and every change it makes is restored when it ends, on an error or
on Ctrl-C. Disruptive sections are skipped over SSH or without a local seat
(presence.py). Everything runs through a Guarded host (safety.py): the tool
never reboots, and never touches disk encryption or boot files.
