"""The Sleep section: suspend and resume on the lid, clamshell mode, and Wi-Fi and Thunderbolt after resume.

The tool never suspends the Mac itself (safety.py refuses every way to):
the human closes the lid, only after answering y to the prompt, and opens it
again. The section is disruptive (never over SSH or without a local seat).

Each lid step, while the human closes and opens the lid:

  - a few lines of shell on the Mac (LID_WATCH_SCRIPT) poll logind's
    LidClosed and Hyprland's monitors every 0.5 s and print when the lid
    closed and opened and each connector's state (eDP-1=off USB-2=on): only
    connector names, never a monitor's make, model or serial. Its limits
    count polls, not seconds, so the watch is bounded while the Mac is awake
    and simply pauses while it's asleep; the times it prints are the wall
    clock's, so a suspend shows as a jump. The human has CLOSE_SECONDS to
    close the lid; at a terminal the watch runs on it (run_tty) and shows a
    countdown on one line, and any key ends the wait (the step is skipped);
  - then the system log since the step began (JOURNAL_SCRIPT) is reduced on
    the Mac to event words and times: logind's lid and suspend lines, the
    kernel's PM: suspend entry/exit, a failed suspend, Thunderbolt link
    errors. No host name or message text leaves the Mac.

Suspend (sleep.lid-suspend), with no external display: it passes when the
kernel entered suspend after the lid closed; the evidence says how soon, in
which mode (s2idle) and for how long. No suspend in the time the lid was
closed fails, unless an external display was on (the Mac is meant to stay
awake then) or logind is set not to suspend on the lid: those are skipped.

Clamshell (sleep.clamshell, Omarchy's integration), with an external display
on: it passes when the Mac didn't suspend, the built-in screen was off and
an external display on while the lid was closed, and the built-in screen
came back once it opened. The recorded failure (M2 Max, 2026-09-26) is a
Mac that suspended although Hyprland had moved to the USB-C display: logind
counts only HDMI, DisplayPort and similar connectors as external, and
Apple Silicon's DP alt mode displays are DRM connector type "USB", so logind
wasn't Docked. logind's Docked and HandleLidSwitchDocked are in the evidence.

After the first resume (sleep.wifi-after-resume, sleep.thunderbolt-after-resume):
what was up before the lid closed (LINKS_SCRIPT: Wi-Fi interfaces up with an
IPv4 address, Thunderbolt networking interfaces up, the number of
Thunderbolt/USB4 devices) is polled every second for RECOVERY_SECONDS after
the kernel's suspend exit. The human is told first that the run waits up to
that long, and the polls stay out of the live feed, which says only what
came back and when: a feed redrawn with the same poll every second for half
a minute looked like a run stuck in a loop (the M2 Max, 2026-09-27, whose
Thunderbolt networking didn't come back, so the wait ran its full length). Each passes when everything came back, with how
long it took; skipped when nothing of the kind was up before. Only interface
names and counts are printed, never an address.

The run survives the suspend: the process sleeps with the Mac and carries on.
If it's stopped anyway (the terminal closed, the Mac had to be started again),
the step it was in is in the checkpoint (Context.progress): the next run
offers to resume and judges that step from the system log since it began, or
fails it when the Mac was started again (a different boot id) in the
meantime. Finished steps aren't asked again.
