"""The Power section: the battery, its charge limit, idle power draw and, optionally, drain while asleep.

Battery (power.battery): hardware.battery.

Charge limit (power.charge-limit, the macsmc-battery driver): the Apple SMC's
end threshold (/sys/class/power_supply/macsmc-battery/charge_control_end_threshold)
is set to 80% and read back, then cleared to 100% and read back. The driver
derives the start threshold from it (charging restarts at 75% under an 80%
limit); the SMC takes only 80 or 100. Writing it needs root:
`sudo -n sh -c SET_SCRIPT sh 80`.

Saved limit (power.charge-limit-kept, omarchy-mac's integration): omarchy-mac's
`omarchy battery charge limit` (omarchy-battery-charge-limit) shows the limit,
sets 80 and saves it to /etc/udev/macsmc-battery.conf, and 100 clears it; its
udev rule (94-omarchy-mac-battery-charge-limit.rules) runs
/usr/lib/omarchy-mac/battery-charge-limit-restore as the battery appears at
boot, to put the saved limit back. It passes when the command, the rule and
the helper are installed, the command reads the limit sysfs has, and both
settings stick, with 80 saved for the next boot. Nothing is rebooted, so the
rule itself isn't run.

Before either changes anything, one restorer is registered (RESTORE_SCRIPT,
as root): the original end threshold, then, 2 s later, the original saved
file as it was (its text, or no file). The wait is for asahi-scripts' path
unit (macsmc-battery-charge-control-end-threshold.path), which saves every
change to the threshold into that same file by itself. The checks put both
back themselves when they're done, read them back and drop the restorer; it
only runs if they couldn't (an error, Ctrl-C, or the next run after one that
was killed).

On battery: the last two checks measure the battery while it runs the Mac,
and on AC power it doesn't show the Mac's draw. So first thing in the
section, before anything else runs, a Mac on AC power at its seat says so
and waits up to UNPLUG_SECONDS for the charger to come out (UNPLUG_SCRIPT
polls the battery's status; at a terminal it shows a countdown on one line,
and any key stops waiting); over SSH or without a local seat nobody can
unplug it, so both are skipped. A charger left in skips both, saying so
when the section gets to them: they never end silently (the M2 Max,
2026-09-27, said "about ten minutes" and went straight to the report).

Idle power (power.idle-draw): the battery's power_now (microwatts), or
current_now times voltage_now, sampled every second for IDLE_SECONDS on the
Mac (IDLE_SCRIPT) while it runs on battery. It fails when the battery
reports no draw while discharging; the evidence gives the average, lowest and
highest.

Sleep drain (power.sleep-drain, optional, at the Mac only, asked only on
battery): the human closes the lid for about ten minutes and opens it again;
the tool never puts the Mac to sleep itself (safety.py). The lid watch and the
system log are the Sleep section's (sleep.py). The battery's energy before
and after, over the time the kernel says it was asleep, gives the drain in
watts and percent per hour; it fails above DRAIN_FAIL_PERCENT_PER_HOUR. The
step is checkpointed before the lid closes (Context.progress), so a run
stopped while the lid was closed judges it, when resumed, from the system log
and the battery then.

Privacy: macsmc-battery also exposes the battery's serial number, manufacture
date, model name and cycle count. None of them is read: only the status,
capacity, thresholds, power, current, voltage, energy and charge, as numbers.
