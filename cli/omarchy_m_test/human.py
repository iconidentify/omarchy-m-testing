"""Human checks: the tool asks, the human answers yes, no or skip, with an optional note.

    result = human.check(ctx, "audio.speaker-tone", "Did you hear a short tone from both speakers?",
                         evidence=["played a 1 kHz tone at 30% volume"])

The result is a schema-v1 check of kind "human": yes passes, no fails, skip
(or no answer at all: end of input, three answers that aren't y/n/s) is
skipped, never a failure. A bare Enter is yes, the default, and passes too,
but nobody typed it: the result says answered_by_default, and the site shows
it as unconfirmed and never lets it colour the matrix. Its evidence holds what was asked, the
answer and the note, which passes the privacy scrubber like any evidence
before it reaches the checkpoint or the report. The check id must be in the
catalogue's checks, and in its section's human_checks so a skipped section
reports it as human too.

Ctrl-C at the question interrupts the run like anywhere else: the section's
restorers run and the run can resume.
