"""The Audio section's live checks: the microphone, a speaker tone and the headphone jack.

Microphone (automatic): 3 s from the default input, measured in memory by
a few lines of Python on the Mac (peak and RMS); the sound itself is never
kept, recorded or uploaded. It passes when the peak reaches MIC_MIN_PEAK
(room noise does). Only the built-in microphone is tested: another default
input (a USB or Bluetooth headset) skips it.

Speaker tone (human): nothing plays until speaker protection is confirmed
active, all three of:

  - speakersafetyd is active (systemctl is-active speakersafetyd);
  - this boot's kernel log says "Speaker volumes unlocked", which
    snd-soc-macaudio logs once speakersafetyd has lifted the amps' -100 dB
    lock (read as the user, else through sudo -n);
  - the default output is asahi-audio's DSP filter sink for the speakers
    (audio_effect.<board>-convolver), so the tone goes through the speaker
    model, never straight to the amps.

Anything else skips the check with the reason, and the volume is never
touched. Then the default sink is set to 30% (changes.set_volume caps it
there and puts it and the mute back when the section ends), and a 2 s tone
at about -12 dBFS, faded in and out, plays on that sink by name.

Headphone jack (human): the human plugs headphones in and says whether the
Mac noticed; the default output afterwards is kept as evidence.

Output and input names are only recorded when they are the Mac's own
(platform sinks, the DSP sinks, the microphone mapping): other names can
carry a Bluetooth address or a USB serial number.
