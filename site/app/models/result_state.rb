# What a feature does on a Mac, in the site's colour code:
#
#   works           green    every tested check works
#   partial         yellow   some checks work and others don't, or machines disagree
#   regression      red      doesn't work, and a verified earlier run on the same
#                            model and stack found it working (Regressions)
#   fails           orange   doesn't work although it should on this Mac, with no
#                            verified earlier pass to call it a regression
#   missing         blue     expected missing: not yet in Aurora, Asahi or Omarchy
#   unknown         magenta  unknown hardware
#   not-applicable  (none)   this Mac doesn't have the hardware
#   not-tested      grey     no check was run
