# The Aurora feature-support table: what the Aurora kernel (omacom/linux)
# supports per chip generation, from tester-verified runs on it, that is
# visible tester runs (Report#tester?) with the linux-aurora package. A cell
# is the state the tester machines on that chip generation agree on, each
# machine counted once with its latest run that tested the feature
# (MatrixCell), partial when they disagree. It sits next to the catalogue's
# expected Aurora and Asahi states, and its sources are the runs behind it
# and the Aurora versions they ran. Kernel features only: the Asahi and
# Aurora layers, not Omarchy's integration.
