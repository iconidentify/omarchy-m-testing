# One uploaded report. The body is the schema-validated report as the CLI sent
# it, less its machine signature; public_id is the unguessable id in its URL.
# Only a digest of the deletion token is stored; the token itself is returned
# once, at upload.
#
# machine_id groups reports by machine for the "two or more distinct machines
# agree" rule: "key:" and a keyed digest of the machine's verified public key
# (MachineSignature), never shown, never exported. Reports from before machine
# keys have "ip:" and a keyed digest of the uploader's network instead, and
# those without either (the very first ones) all count as a single machine.
#
# tester_login is the GitHub handle the machine was bound to when the report
# was uploaded (TesterBinding): the report is a tester run while that handle
# is on the allowlist (Tester). The handle is shown only to the admin.
